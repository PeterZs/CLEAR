CLEAR: Counting and Location Estimate using Ambient Radio signals
=================================================================
*This project uses backscattered signal from ambient RFID tags to count the number of occupants and their locaitons in a room using machine learning and inverse problem solutions.*

## Problem Model
--------------
There are two linear problem models developed, using:
- Multipath scattering-based<sup>1</sup> (mainly depending on phase), and 
- Line-of-Sight (LoS) attenuation-based<sup>2</sup> (mainly depends on received signal strength (RSS)).
